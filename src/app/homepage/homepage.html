        Wasn’t anything unusual, If anything it was too normal. We met during
        university time through a group assignment. At first, I didn’t think
        about it at all, thought it was just like any other people I’ve met,
        work together, then leave.

        <br /><br />

        Although her first impression towards me was, unusual?

        <br /><br />

        “Scream my name if you can’t find me in class”

        <br /><br />

        she said through Instagram. I found this funny at the time, so I went
        along and said I “would definitely” or something like that, even though
        I’m super introverted.

        <br /><br />

        Of course, the next day we met and I never screamed anything, instead I
        walked up to her and asked “silently”.

        <br /><br />

        Other than that, nothing unusual happened, and that concluded the first
        time.

        Days passed by, all of our meetings and discussions so far happened
        during class or Instagram.

        <br /><br />

        There was one day I asked the entire group out to meet in person on
        campus just to finish up our assignment. The other group members
        couldn’t make it so it ended up with me and her.

        <br /><br />

        I had gym beforehand. We texted the night before saying we’d meet up at
        around 6 P.M. I started walking to campus around 5:30 PM ish and I swear
        I could not make this up. The sky at the moment, the clouds had a shape,
        it was a heart, shaped vaguely. I thought it was pretty, so I took a
        picture of it.

        <br /><br />

        At that moment I didn’t think much of it. But I’m sometime can become
        quite “imaginative” excuses for “delusional”, and looking back, isn’t
        the sky that day beautiful?

        I got there right at 6 PM. We didn’t plan very well that day, none of us
        knew that the building would be close at 6 PM, well not “close” but
        restricted access. So, we were kicked out at the end.

        <br /><br />

        It was pretty cold that day, we could have gone anywhere but ended up
        deciding on sitting near the LTB building, on a bench, under this tree.
        So just like any other assignment we pulled out our laptop and started
        working on it. Normally, the discussion of a group assessment based on
        my experience at Monash is that people only talked about the
        “assignment”, for me I was trying to get it done as soon as possible
        since I was pretty tired that day.

        <br /><br />

        But, for some reason, the assignment discussion slowly, turning into a
        talk about, our past relationships?...

        <br /><br />

        It wasn’t even a short one. We talked until like 8PM. I don’t remember
        how it started, but I am glad it did.

        <br /><br />

        I learned that she was taken at that moment. I also learned that her and
        her boyfriend at that moment wasn’t very “Happy”. She talks a lot about
        him, saying how she wanted to marry this guy, if possible, which I found
        cute.

        <br /><br />

        Although she also talked about how her and her boyfriend had arguments
        and it wasn’t going as well as it should. I gave her some advice and put
        some logical sense into it and tried to tell her that she should have a
        talk with him, cause at the point I genuinely wanted to help them.

        My past relationship isn’t the best, I rarely share it with other
        people, since it is sensitive to me. But for some reason, during that
        conversation with her, I brought it up, something that I did only to
        those who are really close.

        <br /><br />

        I told her everything about this relationship that I had and how it made
        me fail my first-year unit (failing that unit is so shameful cause it is
        so easy).

        <br /><br />

        She’s a good listener, but I don’t know why I shared that with her at
        that moment. You could say I felt comfortable enough to share that, but
        that was the first time we’ve met, odd?

        <br /><br />

        It was something about her presence that just simply felt calm and free
        of judgement.

        <br /><br />

        We kept on talking about it, got COMPLETELY side-tracked and ended up
        not finishing anything. It was getting pretty cold and late, so we
        decided to head home.

        <br /><br />

        Although, what surprised me the most is that I wanted to talk to her
        more.

        <br /><br />

        That night I went home and I felt happy.

        It was fast, but pleasant. Little did I know, I started to talk to her
        more, we exchanged messages more, sometimes about random topics,
        sometimes about assignments.

        <br /><br />

        Time went by, and I found myself attending lectures with her, something
        I never do my entire life, and that’s not even the most surprising. I
        also ended up attending her unit’s lecture.

        <br /><br />

        We had more frequent meetings on campus in person. Sometimes without the
        other member sometime with (once).

        <br /><br />

        At this point, I still didn’t think much of it, but I did know a fact
        and that fact is that I really enjoyed talking to her and seeing her, I
        see her as really, great friend to have.

        <br /><br />

        At this point, I also opened up to her quite “too much”. I told her
        everything about how I felt, and basically everything about my past
        relationship.

        <br /><br />

        She also talks about her relationship often, her random work, her random
        case comp…etc, and we kept on exchanging about it.

        Somehow, she got me attending a lecture, first in my life (second since
        the first day of year 1). I was near a shop, so I decided to buy some
        popcorn chicken at this place (it wasn’t good) cause why not.

        <br /><br />

        Nothing unusual happened, just a typical lecture. I sat next to her, and
        we were just listening along to the lecturer.

        <br /><br />

        I asked if she wanted some popcorn chicken, she took one or two I don’t
        remember.

        <br /><br />

        I was going to grab a piece but accidentally knocked off the entire
        thing, it was probably super embarrassing, especially when she’s there.

        <br /><br />

        I was going to clean up, but then she already got started on it?

        <br /><br />

        Wait.

        <br /><br />

        She already got started on it? She got out all the tissue out and wiping
        and stuff. So I was like, wait what are you doing? Of course I didn’t
        say it, but I was, confused yet surprised?

        <br /><br />

        Maybe I’m weird for thinking like this, but at that point in time I
        thought.

        <br /><br />

        Wow, she’s a really nice person.

        This was I think, coming up to the end of the group assignment, we were
        wrapping it up and I was there to help with her portion. There were only
        2 of us, just like usual.

        <br /><br />

        Nothing really to talk about, it was just the usual laptop work, and I
        sat there watching her do her work and occasionally helped her if she
        has questions.

        <br /><br />

        This was probably the first sign.

        <br /><br />

        When I watched her do her assignment. I caught my eye on her for a fair
        bit and since were were sitting next to each other and pretty close.

        <br /><br />

        I never really cared about it, until that night, for some reason, I
        found her pretty.

        <br /><br />

        She stood up and said something like “This shirt is one of the best
        looking one that I had”.

        <br /><br />

        To be fair, anything she wore fits perfectly. But of course, I didn’t
        say that at the time, I don’t think I even replied but just nodded with
        a “mhm”.

        <br /><br />

        We walked home pretty late; I don’t remember what time it was. I think
        we finished a huge portion of the assignment, and she decided to send
        our group mate a voice message during the walk and just yeeted her phone
        at my face, I didn’t know what to say, I forgot what I said, haha.

        <br /><br />

        That day, I tried to refuse my thoughts multiple times when I got home,
        and even days afterwards. But in the end, I couldn’t deny it.

        After that night, I had a long thought, many days, long thought.

        <br /><br />

        I didn’t want to accept what I was thinking. I didn’t want to accept the
        feelings. I didn’t want to believe that it was true.

        <br /><br />

        So, I gaslighted myself that this was just something dumb. But of
        course, that didn’t work for long.

        <br /><br />

        I didn’t want to ruin anything, I didn’t want to make her feel awkward
        if I were to confess, and plus it would be a horrible idea to do such a
        thing when she is taken, since I wanted them to work out too.

        <br /><br />

        I didn’t want to lose her as a friend, since I trusted her in terms of
        expressing myself. She was the first one (only one) in university where
        I had the chance to do that.

        <br /><br />

        I honestly, really did, wanted to keep talking to her. But I couldn’t.

        The semester is coming to a close.

        <br /><br />

        She said, “So, we won’t be talking anymore after this?”

        <br /><br />

        I replied, “No, it’s fine, you can message me anytime”

        <br /><br />

        She replied, “But wouldn’t that be weird?”

        <br /><br />

        Mhm, it would be weird, knowing I could just do something about it. but
        then I said, “Why would it be weird?”

        <br /><br />

        Knowing that we would stop talking here. This was my excuse to distance
        myself from her.

        <br /><br />

        I had to because I had to make these feelings go away, I didn’t want to
        ruin anything and this was, to me, it seems like the best option at the
        time.

        <br /><br />

        It hurts to let go and seems like I didn’t care, but it was the last
        choice. I know she’d be fine with it, I hope she was.

        <br /><br />

        And so, it was.

        <br /><br />

        Thought it was the end.

        Speed up to the end of second year, entering summer 2025. A friend
        introduced me to this unit and said it is offered in the summer, said it
        was like a “mini-internship, like a cv booster thing”.

        <br /><br />

        So, I was like, ok why not? Because I still have a unit that I needed to
        re-do.

        <br /><br />

        It was the first week or second, when Jolie appeared out of nowhere, and
        ran up to me.

        <br /><br />

        That day, I swear I had the ugliest hair I’ve ever had in my entire
        existence.

        <br /><br />

        So, when she came by and said hi, the first thing I thought of is not
        “What the fuck? Why is she here?”

        <br /><br />

        But,

        <br /><br />

        “My hair is too ugly please don’t look”

        <br /><br />

        I looked like I just got out of military service.

        <br /><br />

        I said hi, was surprised that she was here, we couldn’t talk for long
        since I was rushing with a friend to attend the next session.

        It has been almost half a year since we talked. Seeing her that day
        honestly did surprise me a lot since I expected to never see her again.

        <br /><br />

        At this point, my feelings weren’t the same as before, they faded a fair
        bit. So, seeing her just sparked a surprise in me, nothing more nor
        less.

        <br /><br />

        However, I did want to see her again.

        <br /><br />

        Which I got the chance to, since she asked.

        <br /><br />

        “If you want to meetup, I can check your presentation for you”

        <br /><br />

        Obviously, I said yes, cause, well.

        <br /><br />

        1) My presentation actually needed checks by her since she has lots of
        experience in this. 2) I wanted to see her (haha)

        <br /><br />

        So, we met that day, said how we’ve been, and all of that. She had a
        look at the visual of my team presentation and laughed at it,

        <br /><br />

        “Omg this is your intro slide? Who made this?”

        <br /><br />

        Yeah, I know right, there was this hyper-active dude who put way too
        much effort into doing this stuff.

        <br /><br />

        Who talked about how our careers are, internships and what not. She
        seemed demotivated about it so said it’s going to be okay and tried to
        brighten it up. To be fair, I know she’d be okay.

        <br /><br />

        I never got the chance to say how awesome she is, hoping one day I do.

        <br /><br />

        Although it was just a little catch-up meeting, I felt happy that entire
        day that I got to see her again.

        Last day was the presentation day, after the presentation they will
        announce the winner. Me and my friend left early because we wanted to
        grab a drink.

        <br /><br />

        I was on my way to the train station and she texted me, saying that they
        were announcing the winner, and we could win money.

        <br /><br />

        To be honest, I knew my team wouldn’t win, so I didn’t care at all. So
        normally, I would just say “oh that’s cool” and go on.

        <br /><br />

        BUT,

        <br /><br />

        For some reason, I hopped off my train, I was at Caulfield already by
        then, I decided to wait for the train at Caulfield to go BACK to CBD
        (???).

        <br /><br />

        But the train got delayed so I gotta keep talking to her on the phone,
        and she was giving me live updates and reactions.

        <br /><br />

        As you can already tell by reading this, I was just, really, waiting for
        the train to come on time so I would already get back.

        <br /><br />

        Cause I honestly, really, honestly think that if she won, I could have
        been there.

        <br /><br />

        But, the train delayed, and the thing ended before I even step on the
        train, so I ended up going back either way…

        <br /><br />

        The question I asked myself on the day was,

        <br /><br />

        “Why did I step off my first train? I didn’t have any feelings at that
        point for her though??????”

        <br /><br />

        Although after MIG, I still don’t maintain contact with her, we only got
        the chance to talk during MIG.

        <br /><br />

        I mainly didn’t want to reach out because it took me quite some time to
        get dis-attached and I felt like if I were to keep on texting her it
        would annoy her.

        Fast forward to almost a year. I don’t exactly recall how this happened.
        All I remember was, somehow, we ended up playing badminton together
        after almost half a year of not talking. This started around,
        approaching the end of the third year, first semester.

        <br /><br />

        At this point, even when I met her again, admittedly, I had no feelings
        whatsoever towards her. Although I did continuously ask her for
        badminton because we were short on player.

        <br /><br />

        Time went by, as we continue on playing, and one day, a friend of mine
        stated a statement that surprised me till today, he said,

        <br /><br />

        “Are you guys together?”

        <br /><br />

        I replied with a,

        <br /><br />

        “What no, that would never happen lol”

        <br /><br />

        Of course, the “lol” was to simulate that I actually laugh out loud.

        <br /><br />

        Even though I didn’t think much of it, I would be lying if I said it
        didn’t linger in my mind.

        Sometime linger feelings from the past can be sparked easily. This is an
        example of it.

        <br /><br />

        I didn’t have any feelings toward her at this point, even when I saw I
        landed on her “close friend” it didn’t spark anything. Although I did
        treat her as a close friend at this point, nothing more.

        <br /><br />

        It started small, I was in Vietnam, so we didn’t see each other for
        quite a while. Although that one night where I randomly put up a
        “Cantonese” song, specifically:

        <br /><br />

        “All That I Want – Jay Fung”

        <br /><br />

        She reached out.

        <br /><br />

        From there, we started sharing songs, and she started to recommend some
        really good songs that I still listen to today.

        <br /><br />

        It’s been a really long time since I exchanged songs with somebody else.
        I had fun doing it.

        <br /><br />

        At this point, I still had no feelings, although I did enjoy talking to
        her.

        Fast forward, I was back in Australia, before her. She went back near
        the first week of the semester, this was also, our last semester.

        <br /><br />

        This was also when I moved to South Yarra, so my usual path to
        university deviates a bit. I had to take the shuttle bus from Caulfield
        to Clayton, and vice versa when going back home.

        <br /><br />

        It was Thursday, right after I finished my 2PM class, hopped on the
        shuttle bus at around 2:10 PM. Of course, as usual, just minding my own
        business with my air pods on. Got back home at around 4 PM or so.

        <br /><br />

        I received a notification at around some time at night that day, it was
        from her.

        <br /><br />

        “I was in the same shuttle bus with you today”

        <br /><br />

        I was surprised, obviously since I didn’t notice her at all anywhere, as
        we talked, I learned that she was behind the whole time,

        <br /><br />

        “In your own world with those air pods every time”, she said.

        <br /><br />

        Well, what am I supposed to do? I didn’t see my world was in the same
        bus as me…

        <br /><br />

        I told her that next week I’ll keep an eye out for her at that exact
        time, and so, I did.

        Rushing to the bus since I was running late, the bus was crowded, I
        didn’t spot her at first, so I thought she wasn’t on it, then I received
        her message and turned around.

        <br /><br />

        It was Autumn that day, the wind was strong and it was semi-cold.

        <br /><br />

        Was it really her? My mind was blanked for a whole minute, I didn’t know
        what to say. The scarf she had on that day suited her perfectly, and the
        outfit was speechless.

        <br /><br />

        I think the entire trip, I couldn’t help it but glance at her multiple
        times. I couldn’t talk a lot during that whole trip because my entire
        attention was, well, you guessed it.

        <br /><br />

        Yep, it’s back, all rushing back, everything, but this time, I fell for
        her first sight, fell deeper because of her personality,

        I decided to keep it a secret, tried to avoid it just like the first
        time, since I noticed she had already got someone else, again.

        <br /><br />

        Although this time I didn’t bother to ask about him because I didn’t
        want to.

        <br /><br />

        This time, I chose to completely ignore the fact that she has someone,
        well not “completely” but it never appeared in my mind, and it flow that
        way.

        Friday was when we had our badminton weekly, and afterwards we headed to
        lunch then to the library to get some work done, although I doubted, I
        got nothing done haha.

        <br /><br />

        Maybe this was the second time that we were together at the Matheson, we
        were on the first floor, the entire time I was just watching her
        submitting her CVs to some places, then working on her thing,
        occasionally did some of my own stuff, but mainly that.

        <br /><br />

        Sounds boring, but to me, I wanted to stay forever even if my back was
        literally screaming.

        <br /><br />

        Maybe it was peaceful to me, maybe I was glancing at her multiple times,
        or maybe I felt free, I don’t really know.

        <br /><br />

        I vaguely recalled, she wanted to go to New Zealand. I think when I
        heard that, I also, wanted to go to New Zealand, duh.

        <br /><br />

        “Next time you better lock in, okay?”, she said

        <br /><br />

        “Mhm yeah” was all I said, but how long would that “next time” last?

        It was the Kiri T concert day, Friday. We had badminton that day also,
        and did the same routine as usual, badminton, lunch, then library. Her
        concert was at 7 PM ish, so we left around 5 PM.

        <br /><br />

        Night before, I did text and asked her to tag along with me for
        groceries since she kept on eating EXPIRED FOOD, and I genuinely got
        worried a lot. But it was too bad we couldn’t since she had a concert.

        <br /><br />

        Anyways, we were going to catch the shuttle bus to Caulfield for the
        train since the Cranbourne line was down that day (I think). But the
        shuttle bus was stacked so we had to take the normal bus to Caulfield
        which takes longer.

        <br /><br />

        The entire trip was just basically, she took my phone and recommended a
        bunch of songs, and of course, I saved all of them, still listen to them
        until today, because they are genuinely good and well, you guessed it.

        <br /><br />

        But apart from that, there is nothing else to say.

        <br /><br />

        We got off at South Yarra, and she got on a tram to head to the concert.
        Now, in my head I was wondering about 2 options.

        <br /><br />

        I REALLY wanted to tag along, but I didn’t say it because I was, I DON’T
        KNOW, because I think she would deny it anyways. So, I picked option 1
        and headed home.

        <br /><br />

        “Today is so short”, a text messaged from her, and I said, “your day
        hasn’t ended yet”.

        <br /><br />

        Well, I mean, if you think it’s short, then try imagining how I felt. I
        genuinely did, wanted to spend more time with her.

        <br /><br />

        If I could go back in time, I would definitely book a ticket, so this
        time I have a valid excuse to, uh, yeah. Plus, Kiri T is good, valid
        excuse!

        Yeah, the heading said it. Even though I suppose not to, I knew that I
        was meant to keep it to myself. I knew it was going to end badly, but I
        did it anyways, because I thought I was doing a good thing.

        <br /><br />

        I asked her that night beforehand for a meetup at the library, she
        booked a room, I guessed she already knew what I was going to say.

        <br /><br />

        I was scared that day, even though I already knew that she would end up
        rejecting me. But I guess some of me still didn’t want to believe it.

        <br /><br />

        I came unprepared of what to say, I wanted to be natural. When I was at
        the library, I insisted on going to the meeting area, of course, I was
        scared, but I did it anyways.

        <br /><br />

        In my mind at that point was “just get it over, you already know the
        outcome”.

        <br /><br />

        We talked, I confessed, in a shit way, probably my most immature moment,
        still feel ashamed.

        <br /><br />

        I didn’t really let her say what she wanted, I guess I didn’t want to
        hear what she got to say, which is horrible.

        “You are hard to reach out you know? As in like you were in Vietnam”,
        she said.

        <br /><br />

        I could fly back u know…, srsly, like, even if u say just 1 word.

        <br /><br />

        It ended quite fast. I got most of the things I wanted to say.

        <br /><br />

        But there were a lot of regrets, the first obvious one was because I
        didn’t let her say anything nor expressed herself, I wish I did.

        <br /><br />

        But the biggest regret was, saying it, because from here on, everything
        changed.

        From here, it was obvious, it was bound to end, one way or another. It
        doesn’t matter whether one tried to rebound, fix, try harder or
        anything. No one was to blame.

        <br /><br />

        There were attempts being made to mend things between us. But once a
        feeling gets re-sparked, it’s difficult to shut it down.

        <br /><br />

        The most memorable moment since the first confession was a birthday gift
        I gave her.

        <br /><br />

        A bunny that I bought by mistake, it was gray, I was aiming for a blue
        one. I remembered her expression that day. I can tell that she loved the
        gift, I was happy that she did, I was happy that I saw her smile, I
        wanted to give her more, so I promised myself to do better, try harder,
        become better, maybe things will get better.

        <br /><br />

        But when things are meant to end, it will.

        “Why did you bring that bunny with you?”

        <br /><br />

        “If you don’t want to, I won’t”

        <br /><br />

        “I didn’t say that”

        <br /><br />

        I felt happy, seeing that the bunny I gifted you, was with you. Of
        course, I never got to say that to her.

        <br /><br />

        And that’s all, next morning, everything ended.

        <br /><br />

        Did it end with a goodbye? No, it didn’t, it was sudden. It had me
        question,

        <br /><br />

        “Why did it end so quick? Did I mean anything to her?”

        <br /><br />

        I can’t certainly say I did nor I didn’t. If I were to not mean much,
        that’s alright. It was sort of my fault at the start. I ended the
        friendship because of personal desire. I knew she was taken, yet I
        expressed, was a selfish act coming from me.

        I accepted that she departed from my life, for good this time. I
        convinced myself that it is a fact for a while.

        <br /><br />

        Admittedly, I was sad for a while, I missed her, a lot. I distracted
        myself since it was exam period, it worked alright.

        <br /><br />

        Whenever night hits, it came back and strikes. Time to time I dream of
        her, probably two or three times by now.

        <br /><br />

        Occasionally, I wake up at 5 AM, couldn’t get out of bed till 7 or 8 AM.

        <br /><br />

        I just couldn’t understand why, it has to end like that.

        <br /><br />

        I did understand why it has to end, but with no closure? No farewell?
        Nothing.

        I didn’t know why. I just thought it was graduation period, and I wanted
        to do something for her. So, without thinking much, I just did.

        <br /><br />

        I sat down and created a website. I didn’t know why I did it. I did,
        wished that she would read it.

        <br /><br />

        Maybe I do know why. But it’s hard to accept. I wanted her back. I
        didn’t want to lose her.

        <br /><br />

        A part of me said it’s okay if we’re just friends. Whenever I think of
        her, I think of things that I could do for her.

        <br /><br />

        This might sound like a cringey thing to say, but I did like doing
        things for her and with her. I didn’t care what it was, I just really
        enjoyed anything with her.

        <br /><br />

        “My attempts of getting you back”, this is when I realized, I did fell
        for her. It was a surprise.

        <br /><br />

        I never fell for anybody like this before, when people tend to distant
        themselves, I let them go, I didn’t care. I only cared about my ego back
        then.

        <br /><br />

        But now, without realizing, my ego doesn’t matter anymore. I wanted her
        back, wanted? No, I want her back.

        <br /><br />

        This time, if there was some miracle, I would never risk losing her.

        But did I truly want her? Yes.
        <br /><br />

        Why? Because she was there when I most needed somebody and she’s pretty
        :>
        <br /><br />

        How was she different from other people? Her personality made me feel
        okay being myself. When I was with her, she was kind, she spoke with her
        action, little action that maybe she never notices.

          Normally I'd style it so that its shorter and more concise, at the
          same time keeping the original feel intact.
